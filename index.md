[EDAM](https://github.com/edamontology){:target="_blank"} is an ontology focusing on the field of data analysis and management, in life science and beyond. An ontology allows conceptualising complex knowledge by defining explicit, shared vocabulary in the form of concepts that have persistent IDs and can be linked through semantic relationships. EDAM has 4 main sections related to one another: ‘operations’ are concrete actions that usually have defined input and output data, ‘data’ are associated with file ‘formats’, and they can all have one or several ‘topics’.

Those concepts can be used to annotate resources, choose proper terminologies, and ultimately increase the findability and interoperability of tools or services. The prupose of this portfolio is to describe those resources and the way they make use of EDAM. 

EDAM is developed collaboratively on [Github](https://github.com/edamontology){:target="_blank"}.s
