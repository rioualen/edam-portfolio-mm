Target audience for main sections

Beginner level = layperson, collabs with experimental biologists or bioinformaticians new to EDAM/ontologies...

Intermediate level = get into RDF standards, git, and editing EDAM with git

Advanced level = EDAM developers, specific tasks (depecrate class, review old PRs, etc etc) - recycle stuff from old RTD - not a priority right now
