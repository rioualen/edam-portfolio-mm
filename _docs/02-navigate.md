### The EDAM browser

The EDAM browser was developed in order to navigate in the ontology in an intuitive way, display information on each concept , and provide links to some of the associated resources. It also allows to suggest addition or edition of concepts via the submission of a Github issue.  

Make sure to select the latest version of EDAM:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="{{ '/assets/images/EDAM_browser.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Overview of the EDAM browser" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
</div>

EDAM can also be browsed via BioPortal and the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS).
