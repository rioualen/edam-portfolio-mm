## Adding a new concept

EDAM is developed and maintained collectively in Github, in the [edamontology repository](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). In order to edit a repository or suggest changes in it, a GitHub account is required. Check out how to set it up [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github). 

This section describes the procedure to suggest the addition (or edition) of a concept in EDAM, as defined in the previous section “Create a concept”. It will create a “GitHub issue” that the ontology developers can review, discuss, approve of, or where they can ask for specific changes in the request before approval. 

This procedure doesn’t involve coding or manipulating technical files. It can be done either directly on GitHub, or via the EDAM Browser.
