### bio.tools

bio.tools is a community-driven registry of bioinformatics software and data resources. It provides detailed information about software tools, databases, analysis workflows, and services that are used in bioinformatics and the life sciences.

bio.tools holds a collection of more than 30,000 tools, curated and annotated using EDAM concepts. It also provides enhanced search capacities and navigation, as well as an API for easy programmatic access to the database. 

Example of a bio.tools entry annotated with EDAM:

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/EDAM_biotools.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of a tool annotated with EDAM concepts in bio.tools" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
  <h2 style="margin: 0;"></h2>
</div>
