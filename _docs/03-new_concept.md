## Creating or updating a concept

When concepts are needed for a given application, the first step is to identify and list them. This can take the form of a spreadsheet, where each row is associated with a concept, and each column is an attribute.

Following the previous section (“Navigate EDAM/Finding a concept), concepts that are already found available in EDAM can be associated with their “permanent ID” attribute.

Concepts that are not available can be defined with at least the following attributes:

* A label, or main term used to refer to this concept;
* The sub-ontology it belongs in (topic, operation, data or format);
* The direct parent class;
* A concise definition (about 2 or 3 sentences).

Optional attributes may be included, such as:

* A link to a corresponding Wikipedia entry;
* One or several synonyms (exact synonyms or narrow synonyms).

In order to suggest the edition of an existing concept, the information to be changed or added can be included in the table by using the same format.

It is strongly recommended for this work to be done collaboratively, in order to include diverse points of view and reach consensus before implementing changes in the ontology itself.
