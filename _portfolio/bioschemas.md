The Bioconductor project aims to develop, support, and disseminate free open source software for the reproducible analysis of data from biological experiments. It holds a collection of more than 2,000 curated software packages, supporting a vast range of bioinformatics applications that are widely used for gene expression analysis, visualisation, and data integration.

All resources managed by the project are quality-controlled and revised every release. New resources are reviewed and added, and obsolete or unmaintained resources are dropped in a formal deprecation process with a six-month cadence.

Currently, the `biocViews` package (Carey et al., 2024) supports "views" used to classify Bioconductor packages. The biocViews controlled vocabulary is structured as a directed acyclic graph of nearly 500 terms describing package attributes. There are three major classifications, corresponding to "software", "annotation", and "experiment data" packages.

In order to increase the visibility and interoperability of Bioconductor packages, as well as the coverage and validity of Bioconductor in the RSEc, we aim to use the **EDAM ontology** to describe Bioconductor package metadata, and to automate their integration into the [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) registry.
