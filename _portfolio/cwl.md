The [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) (CWL) is an open standard for describing how to run command line tools and connect them to create workflows. Tools and workflows described using CWL are portable across a variety of platforms that support the CWL standards.  
In practice, it strongly recommends for data formats to be specified for all input and output files, and for bioinformatics tools to use format identifiers from EDAM.
